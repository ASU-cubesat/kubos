### **KubOS**
An open source platform for satellites

---


This top level project acts as a workspace for all KubOS RT and KubOS Linux related
projects to help simplify development.

Git repositories are managed with Android's ```repo``` utility, and once the workspace
is initialized, you can use repo to sync the project.

## Getting started

To initialize repo with the top level KubOS manifest, and clone all repositories:

        $ ./init.sh

## Synchronizing repositories

        $ ./repo sync
