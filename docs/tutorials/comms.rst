Communicating with an In-Flight OBC
===================================

The :doc:`communications service <../services/communication>` provides a bridge for communicating
with the satellite in both development and flight environments.

The communication service functions essentially as a UDP tunnel between various
physical transports. It is intended to be used in conjunction with a radio.

The communication service is currently still in development.
This tutorial will be written once that development is complete.

In the meantime, if you would like to integrate a radio with KubOS, please `talk to us <https://slack.kubos.co/>`__
for more information.
