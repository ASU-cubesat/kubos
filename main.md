# KubOS HAL

KubOS-HAL is the primary hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for KubOS. One of our goals is to simplify development when it comes to interfacing with your MCU(s). This module provides a unified set of functions for interfacing with hardware which will work the same across all of our supported MCUs.
