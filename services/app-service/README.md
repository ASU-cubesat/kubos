# Applications Service

The applications service is responsible for monitoring and managing all mission
applications for a system.

The service is capable of tracking multiple versions of each application, allowing
users to easily upgrade and rollback their mission applications when necessary.

Whenever a new application is registered with the service, its manifest file and all
other files in the specified directory are copied into the serviceâ€™s application
registry.
By default, this registry is stored under `/home/system/kubos/apps`.

## Configuration

The service expects the following sections and settings to be present in the configuration file:

```toml
# GraphQL configuration
[app-service.addr]
# IP to bind GraphQL server to
ip = "127.0.0.1"
# Port to listen on for GraphQL queries
port = 8000

# General service configuration
[app-service]
registry-dir = "/home/system/kubos/apps"
```

## Running

This service expects a service configuration file in either the default location
or to be passed in at runtime like so `cargo run -- -c config.toml`.

## Schema

### Queries

```graphql
{
    ping: "pong",
    apps(name: String, version: String, active, Boolean) {
        [entry {
            active: Boolean!,
            app {
                name: String!,
                executable: String!,
                version: String!,
                author: String!
            }
        }]
    }
}
```

### Mutations

```graphql
mutation {
    register(path: String!) {
        success: Boolean!,
        errors: String!,
        entry {
            active: Boolean!,
            app {
                name: String!,
                executable: String!,
                version: String!,
                author: String!
            }
        }
    },
    uninstall(name: String!, version: String) {
        success: Boolean!,
        errors: String!,
    },
    setVersion(name: String!, version: String!) {
        success: Boolean!,
        errors: String!,
    },
    startApp(name: String!, runLevel: String!, config: String, args: [String] {
        success: Boolean!,
        errors: String!,
        pid: Int
    }
